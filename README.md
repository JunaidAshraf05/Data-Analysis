# Weather Data Analysis 🌦️

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset using Python, providing insights into temperature trends, wind speed patterns, and other key meteorological variables. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to analyze and visualize time-series weather data using the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `weather.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle / Sample weather station data
- **Features include:**
  - `Date/Time`: Timestamp of recorded data
  - `Temp (C)`: Temperature in Celsius
  - `Visibility (km)`
  - `Wind Speed (km/h)`
  - `Weather`: Weather condition description
  - And other common meteorological attributes

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Inspecting data structure and cleaning null/missing values
- Analyzing unique weather conditions and their frequencies
- Filtering data based on specific weather events (e.g., fog, snow, clear)
- Exploring trends in temperature and wind speed over time
- Grouping data by day/time to analyze average metrics
- Creating visualizations to show:
  - Temperature distribution
  - Weather condition frequency
  - Correlation heatmaps

## 📈 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data filtering and condition-based querying
- Aggregations and groupby operations
- Basic data visualization for insights

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JunaidAshraf05/Data-Analysis.git
   cd Data-Analysis
Open Weather Data Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

Ensure the required libraries are installed via pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn.
